## üìä Results

- **Total lines reduced:** 182 ‚Üí 69 lines (62% reduction)
- **Methods removed:** 10 unused methods
- **Compilation:** ‚úÖ Successful
- **Functionality:** ‚úÖ Preserved (only used methods remain)

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability** - Less code to maintain
2. **Better Performance** - No unused method overhead
3. **Cleaner API** - Only essential methods exposed
4. **Reduced Complexity** - Easier to understand and modify
5. **No Breaking Changes** - All functionality preserved

## üîç Verification

The cleanup was verified by:
- Checking method usage in service classes
- Running compilation tests
- Ensuring no linting errors
- Preserving all active functionality

All changes maintain backward compatibility and do not affect the application's functionality.
